Ethical Hacking & Vulnerability Assessment Project
Author: Mohamed Allawati
Focus: Reconnaissance, Network Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Assessment & Ethical Hacking Methodology
Target: Mozilla.org (Recon & Scanning) + Windows Lab Environment (Enumeration & Vulnerability Assessment)
________________




Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full ethical hacking workflow including:
* Passive reconnaissance & footprinting
* Active network scanning
* Enumeration
* Lab environment deployment
* Vulnerability assessment
* Risk scoring & mitigation
* Ethical & legal compliance
Due to legal and ethical restrictions, deep enumeration and vulnerability assessment were conducted inside a controlled lab environment, while public reconnaissance was performed against Mozilla infrastructure.

 Phase 1 – Passive Reconnaissance & Footprinting
Objective:
Gather public information without directly interacting with target systems.
Techniques:
* WHOIS lookup
* DNS enumeration
* IP identification
* Mail server discovery
* CDN detection
Kali Linux Commands:
whois mozilla.org
dig mozilla.org ANY
dig mx mozilla.org
nslookup mozilla.org
ping mozilla.org




Key Findings:
* CDN: Google Cloud & Akamai
* IPv4: 35.190.14.201
* Web server behind Google load balancer (nginx)
* Strong TLS configuration & hardened HTTP methods
________________




 Phase 2 – Network Scanning & Service Discovery
Objective:
Identify live hosts, open ports, services, OS fingerprinting, and network exposure.
Kali Linux Commands:
traceroute mozilla.org
nmap -sn mozilla.org
nmap -Pn -sS -p- -T4 mozilla.org
nmap -sV -O mozilla.org
curl -I https://mozilla.org
nc mozilla.org 80




Key Findings:
* Open Ports: 80, 443
* Reverse DNS: googleusercontent.com
* CDN blocks OS fingerprinting
* Strong HTTPS enforcement & HSTS enabled
* Weak cipher detected: 3DES → SWEET32 risk

 Phase 3 – Lab Environment Setup (Legal Compliance)
Due to legal and ethical constraints, enumeration and vulnerability testing were done inside a private lab.
Lab Architecture:
Kali Linux (Attacker) → 192.168.248.129
        |
   Host-Only Network
        |
Windows 10 (Target) → 192.168.248.128




Environment:
* VMware
* Isolated Host-Only Network
* No internet exposure
________________




 Phase 4 – Enumeration (Lab Environment)
Objective:
Extract usernames, groups, machine details, services, routing, and auditing configurations.
Kali Linux Commands:
nbtscan 192.168.248.128
enum4linux -a 192.168.248.128
nmap -p 135,139,445 192.168.248.128
nmap -sU -p 161 192.168.248.128
ip route




Windows Enumeration Commands:
nbtstat -n
nbtstat -s
net user
net localgroup
hostname
ipconfig /all
auditpol /get /category:*
sc query




Key Findings:
* SMB exposed (445/tcp)
* NetBIOS active
* Multiple default Windows services running
* Weak auditing configuration
* Several default users and privileged groups

 Phase 5 – Vulnerability Assessment
Objective:
Identify exploitable weaknesses, misconfigurations, and missing security patches.
Kali Linux Commands:
nmap --script vuln 192.168.248.128
nmap -sV -O 192.168.248.128
searchsploit eternalblue
searchsploit windows smb




Windows Verification:
wmic qfe list | findstr "4012598"
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol




Critical Findings:
* SMBv1 ENABLED
* MS17-010 PATCH MISSING → EternalBlue vulnerable
* NetBIOS exposure
* Excessive running services

* Apply MS17-010 patch
* Restrict SMB access
Short Term:
* Enable strict firewall rules
* Disable NetBIOS if not required
* Implement SMB signing & encryption
Long Term:
* Regular vulnerability scans
* Continuous patch management
* Security hardening audits
